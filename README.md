# Tableau Final Assignment

This repository contains the final assignment for the Tableau course. The goal of this project is to analyze sales and profit data using various types of visualizations in Tableau.

## 📁 Files

- `assignment.twbx`: Tableau workbook with all visualizations and dashboard.

- `instructions.pdf`: Assignment instructions and tasks.

## 📊 Tasks Overview

### Task 1 → `Profit per Category and Subcategory`

Create a Horizontal bar chart to present the Profit per Category and Sub-Category. Use Profit as Label and Color. Hint: Profit should be on the x axis, while Category and Sub-Category on the y axis.

### Task 2 → `Profit per Shipmode`

Create a Pie Chart showing the Profit per Ship Mode. Label it in a way that shows the Ship Mode, the profit of each mode and the total percentage of each mode. Hint: For example a piece of the Pie will display Standard Class - 164.089 - 57,29%.

### Task 3 → `Sales per City`

Create a Bubble Chart showing the Sales per City. In Bubble Chart, cities with a lot of sales will be presented as large bubbles, while cities with fewer sales will be represented as smaller bubbles. Assign a color pallet to show the differentiation at Sales. Hint: New York is the city with the most sales, while Los Angeles comes second.

### Task 4 → `Sales per City over Time`

Create a Continuous Line Chart to display the Sales per City over time (from 2016 to 2019). Filter it to only the top 5 cities based on Sales. Color it by City. Also, put as Label the min and max sales point for each city at this 4-years period. Hint: New York's max sales point is at 86.940 and min at 44.361.

### Task 5 → `Sales per Segment, Category & Shipmode`

Create a Column Chart that shows the Sales per Segment (on the y axis) and per Category and Ship Mode (on the x axis). Color it by Segment.

### Task 6 → `Task 6 Complete`

Can you spot a relation between Discount and Orders made? Create a Horizontal bar chart to present both Discount and number of Orders (columns) per Sub-Category (rows). Color it to easily identify the total orders of each Sub-category and the largest discounts. Additionally, label the graph according to its measure. Hint: This graph is actually a double graph. You should handle each one independently in order to add the Labels and Coloring.

### Task 7 → `Dashboard 2`

Create your final dashboard by combining all the above visuals. Feel free to use your own aesthetic to your dashboard. Hint: Use the filter mode on all your charts but ignore actions on the Line Chart with the top 5 Cities performance (Task 4) and the Column Chart with the Sales per Segment, Category and Ship Mode (Task 5).
